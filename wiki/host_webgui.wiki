#steps required to install the Web GUI under MAMP

= Introduction =

For ease to use of all the applications and elements that are part of this sandboxing system or laboratory, a web GUI has been designed and coded in PHP.

The requirements are minimal, since no database engines are needed at this moment or third party libraries.

= Web server installation =

Before installing the web application, we need to install or configure a web server that supports PHP.

I've chosen MAMP for macosx, you can find it here: http://www.mamp.info/en/

Simply, download the installation package and run it.

Now, you have to:

  * Choose a listening port (ex. 80)
  * Choose the root folder; we will put there the PHP files (ex: ~/htdocs/)

And launch the server. 

Check that the server it's working ok opening the URL http://127.0.0.1/ if you are working with your local server.
