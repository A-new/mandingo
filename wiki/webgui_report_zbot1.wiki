#report generated for the "zbot" malware sample 353f3b54de9ecfd82c63a2aeaf1c3b9c

= Introduction =

To shown you some of results you can obtain with the "Mandingo's Sandbox", I've downloaded one "zbot" malware sample from "zeustracker" that it's currently alive (C&C on). The MD5 hash for this sample is: 353f3b54de9ecfd82c63a2aeaf1c3b9c

I've found this sample here:

https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php?browse=binaries&filter=online

This sample was uploaded from the Web GUI, and was running and monitored during 1 minute, in a virtual guest os "Windows SP SP3 32bit"

= Results viewed from the console =

Before showing you the results in the Web GUI, let's check first what was generated from the console.

The results of the analysis were stored in the folder "sinjector_client/results/353f3b54de9ecfd82c63a2aeaf1c3b9c/"

== What is each file? ==

  # "*newlog.text*" is the log file generated by the "sinjector_exe" application that runs in the virtual guest system and monitors the API calls of the sample submitted
  # "*network.pcap*" is a .pcap file with the network traffic generated (using "tcpdump") from/to the virtual "host-only" interface ("vboxnet0") used for communications between the guest system and Internet.
  # "*processes.txt*" and "*processes_final.txt*" are two list with the processes that were running before the sample was launched, and after, respectively.
  # "*screenshot-\d+segs.png*" files are image files/screenshots of the desktop, taken while the sample was analyzed at different moments.
  # Files starting with "*deteled*" are files that were deleted by the sample after running.
  # The rest of files were generated by the sample in any moment.

We can look for any copy of the malware in this directory looking by their MD5 hash:

{{{
$ md5 *|grep 353f3b54de9ecfd82c63a2aeaf1c3b9c
MD5 (deleted_C:\sinjector\binary4) = 353f3b54de9ecfd82c63a2aeaf1c3b9c
}}}

"C:\sinjector\binary4" is the name that was chosen by "client.py" for uploading the original sample (not the MD5). Since it's "deleted", it means that the malware deleted himself sometime; probably after running it's main process.

Some files can be easy displayed from the console, for example the generated text files, so you can "grep" or parse them with any tool. There're several tools in the "sinjector_client/scripts" folder to parse those files, also the binaries.

For example, to get the deleted files from "newlog.text" you can run:
{{{
