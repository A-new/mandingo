== Web GUI features ===

=== Static analysis ===

  * Details: MD5, file size, file type (magic), internal compilation date, packer identification, compiler identification, version information
  * Sections: name, entry, pointer to raw data, size of raw data, relative percentage, virtual address, flags, entropy, section dumping (raw), etc.
  * Resources: type, graphical display of bitmaps and icons, virtual address, offset to data, size, file offset, language identification, creation date, percentage, resource dumping (raw), etc.
  * Imports: function names, addresses, libraries, links to online documentation
  * Strings: unicode strings, ascii strings
  * Graph: see the binary graphically. Very useful to identify compressed or encrypted parts, paddings, etc. Hexadecimal and ASCII dumping of the data, section starting markers, etc.
