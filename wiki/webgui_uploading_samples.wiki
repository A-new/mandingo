#Uploading malware samples from the web guy

= Introduction =

In this section were going to download a malware sample (you can choose other you have locally stored) and upload it to our Sandbox laboratory using the web gui.


= Some sources for Malware samples =

There're lot of places in Internet for downloading malware samples. By the moment and for demonstration purposes, I'm going to fetch a "zbot" from zeus tracker.

Open your browser and grab one binary from here: https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/monitor.php?browse=binaries

It's interesting to download a malware sample (zbot) that it's online (red color). That means that the C&C (Command and Control) server it's responding; or should be. So, we can generate a ".pcap" file with the network traffic for better understanding of that malware.

I'm going to download the sample with MD5 hash "9d8c4d9d189d5220d10223b2089efa60" for this demonstration.

Save the file locally (do not run it!), and open the web gui if ready; installation of the web gui was covered here: [https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/wiki/host_webgui Installing the Web GUI under MAMP]
