#configuring the host only interface

= Introduction =

In this page I will tell you how to add a host only interface in VirtualBox with the configuration I used to put all the system working.

Requeriments: I assume that you have previously installed "windows xp sp3" operating system.

= Details =

  * Open VirtualBox
  * Go to "Preferences" > "Network" > "Host only network" > "Add" (my new assigned network name "*vboxnet0*")
    * IP: 192.168.56.1
    * Netmask: 255.255.255.0
