#source code for the mandingo's sandbox malware analysis platform

= Hello! ==

These are all the required files I can provide you to run the Mandingo Sandbox :)

===[https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsinjector%2Fsinjector_exe sinjector_exe]===
  * Executable file and source code used to inject the prepared DLL into processes that are going to be analyzed.
  * Runs inside a windows guest operating system
  * Can be executed as an stand-alone program; requires the DLL to inject compiled and some configuration

===[https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsinjector%2Fdlltoinject dlltoinject]===
  * DLL that will be injected in every process analyzed and each subprocess called.

====[https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsinjector%2Fsinjector_client sinjector_client]====
  * This application should be copied at your host system (mine is macosx).
  * Its function is to stablish communications between the host operating system and the virtual machine (windows running with virtualbox).
  * Provide a serie of scripts used to parse the results of the executable samples analyzed

===[https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsinjector%2Fwebgui webgui]===
  * Web interface used to submit the malware samples to the virtual machine; ease of use of all the laboratory.

If you want, read the [https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/source/browse/trunk/sinjector/sinjector_client/CONFIG config] file supplied with the "sinjector_client" application and get some tips for the system setup... but in my opinion, it's preferable to read the documentation provided in the [https://code.google.com/p/mandingo/wiki/MandingoSandbox wiki page] :)
