#Required steps for setting up the virtual guest operating system

= Introduction =

All the malware samples will be run in a virtual operating system. We need to prepare it before analyzing them.

In this pages I will show you the configuration values I choose for this laboratory configuration:

  * macosx as the host operating system
    * mamp in the host as the web server for the gui
  * windows xp sp3 as the guest operating system

= Steps =

We will cover here the following steps:

  # [virtual_config_hostonly Setting up the host-only interface] (vboxnet0 / 192.168.56.1)
  # [virtual_config_ipconfig Setting the guest IP address] (192.168.56.201)
  # [ip_forwarding_config Enabling internet connectivity in the guest os] (macosx instructions only)
  # [sinjector_guest_install Sinjector guest installation]
