All the malware samples will be run in a virtual operating system. We need to prepare it before analyzing them.

In this pages I will show you the configuration values I choose for this laboratory configuration:

  * macosx as the host operating system
    * mamp in the host as the server for the web gui
  * windows xp sp3 as the guest operating system
