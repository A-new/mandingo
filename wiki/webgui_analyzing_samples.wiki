#Analyzing samples from the web gui

= Introduction =

After uploading a sample from the web gui we are ready to analyze it (if all it's working ok).

Basically, you only have to click in the "Analyze" link after submitting the sample.


== If python is not located ==

If you have not configured properly the path of the python interpreter binary in "modules/config.php" you'll get an error like this:

{{{
sh: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python: No such file or directory
}}}

You can try to locate the current working python binary with:

{{{
$ whereis python
/usr/bin/python
}}}

Then, edit the file "modules/config.php" present with the PHP scripts of the webgui, and replace the variable $python, so you can read this:

{{{
<?php
class Config{
        public static $python="/usr/bin/python";
        ...
}}}
